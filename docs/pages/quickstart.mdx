# Quickstart

## Installation

<Tabs items={['Composer (recommended)']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        Run the following command in the root of your project/theme/plugin:

        ```bash copy
        composer require jorenrothman/acf-builder
        ```

        This is currently not supported.
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating a Field Group

To create a field group, you must first create a new instance of the `FieldGroup` class. The constructor requires a single argument, the name of the field group. The name is used to identify the field group in the WordPress admin.

```php
<?php

use JorenRothman\ACFBuilder\FieldGroup;

$fieldGroup = new FieldGroup('My Field Group');
```
That's it! You've created a field group. Now you can add fields to it.

## Adding Fields

To add a field to a field group, you must first create a new instance of a `Field` class. The constructor requires a single argument, the name of the field. The name is used to identify the field in the WordPress admin.

```php
<?php

use JorenRothman\ACFBuilder\FieldGroup;
use JorenRothman\ACFBuilder\Basic\Text;

$fieldGroup = new FieldGroup('My Field Group');

$fieldGroup->addField(
    new Text('My Text Field')
);
```

## Field Group Locations

By default, field groups are assigned to the `post` post type. 
You can change this by using the `setLocations` method on the field group. 
The `setLocations` method accepts a single argument, 
an instance of the `FieldGroupLocations` class. 

```php
<?php

use JorenRothman\ACFBuilder\FieldGroup;
use JorenRothman\ACFBuilder\Basic\Text;
use JorenRothman\ACFBuilder\FieldGroupLocations;

$fieldGroup = new FieldGroup('My Field Group');

$fieldGroup->addField(
    new Text('My Text Field')
);

$locations = new FieldGroupLocations;
$locations->and('post_type', '==', 'page');

$fieldGroup->setLocations($location);

```

This will assign the field group to the `page` post type.

## Register Field Group

Once you've created a field group, you must register it with ACF.

```php
<?php

use JorenRothman\ACFBuilder\FieldGroup;
use JorenRothman\ACFBuilder\Basic\Text;
use JorenRothman\ACFBuilder\FieldGroupLocations;

$fieldGroup = new FieldGroup('My Field Group');

$fieldGroup->addField(
    new Text('My Text Field')
);

$locations = new FieldGroupLocations;
$locations->and('post_type', '==', 'page');

$fieldGroup->setLocations($location);

$fieldGroup->register();
```

Go to the WordPress admin and you should see your field group.

## Querying Fields

To query the field you can use the standard `get_field` function.

The name is automatically generated using the field group name + field name.

**For example,** <br/>if the field group name is `My Field Group` and the field name is `My Text Field`, <br/>the field name will be `my_field_group_my_text_field`.

```php
<?php

$fieldValue = get_field('my_field_group_my_text_field');
```

*A field name is created by converting the field group name and field name to snake case and concatenating them with an underscore.*
